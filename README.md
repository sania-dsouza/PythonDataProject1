# Project includes my first data-driven work using Python and accompanying libraries.

# Some example of projects could be:
# Analyze newspaper headlines of 'The Times of India' from 2000 to 2019 for sentiments
# Find the jobs in India to not work, worked out of the number of deaths caused since 2010
# Enter the day and place to which you plan to travel and the amount of money you will be bringing along, and will provide you useful information about weather conditions and the value of your money.
